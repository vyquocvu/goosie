# Clickable Links with Navigation Integration - Implementation Summary

This document describes the implementation of clickable anchor tags with full navigation integration in the Goosie project.

## Overview

Anchor (`<a>`) tags are now fully interactive and integrated with the browser's navigation system, allowing users to navigate between pages by clicking on links.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Link Detection and Parsing
- Anchor tags are automatically detected during HTML parsing
- The `href` attribute is extracted and stored in the render tree
- Links are properly rendered in both the standard render path and the display list path

### 2. Click Detection and Handling
- Custom `TappableHyperlink` widget that extends Fyne's `widget.Hyperlink`
- Overrides the default tap handler to call the browser's navigation callback
- Maintains visual styling and accessibility features from the base widget

### 3. URL Resolution
- Absolute URLs (http://, https://) are used as-is
- Relative URLs are resolved against the current page URL
- Root-relative URLs (starting with /) are resolved against the domain root
- Implements proper URL resolution using Go's `net/url` package

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Links trigger the same navigation callback as the URL bar and navigation buttons
- Seamless integration with the browser's history and state management
- Works with back/forward navigation

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Links are styled by Fyne's hyperlink widget (blue, underlined text)
- Hover states are handled by Fyne automatically
- Active/visited states can be added in future enhancements

### 6. Keyboard Navigation
- Tab key focuses on links (inherited from `widget.Hyperlink`)
- Enter key activates focused links (inherited from `widget.Hyperlink`)
- Full keyboard accessibility support

## Architecture

### Components Modified

1. **`internal/renderer/renderer.go`**
   - Added `NavigationCallback` type for link click handling
   - Added `onNavigate` callback field to Renderer
   - Added `currentURL` field for resolving relative links
   - Added `SetNavigationCallback()` and `SetCurrentURL()` methods
   - Updated `RenderHTML()` to pass callback to canvas renderer

2. **`internal/renderer/canvas.go`**
   - Added `onNavigate` and `baseURL` fields to CanvasRenderer
   - Added `SetNavigationCallback()` method
   - Updated `renderLink()` to create clickable links
   - Added `resolveURL()` method for URL resolution
   - Created `TappableHyperlink` widget for custom tap handling
   - Updated `renderCommand()` to handle `PaintLink` commands

3. **`internal/renderer/display_list.go`**
   - Added `PaintLink` command type
   - Added `LinkURL` and `LinkText` fields to PaintCommand
   - Updated `addElementCommand()` to generate link paint commands
   - Added `extractText()` helper to extract text from render nodes

4. **`internal/ui/browser.go`**
   - Updated `SetNavigationCallback()` to pass callback to renderer
   - Updated `RenderHTMLContent()` to set current URL for link resolution

### URL Resolution Algorithm

```go
func resolveURL(href string) string {
    // 1. Check if absolute URL (http:// or https://)
    if isAbsolute(href) {
        return href
    }
    
    // 2. Parse base URL
    baseURL := parseURL(currentPageURL)
    
    // 3. Parse relative href
    relativeURL := parseURL(href)
    
    // 4. Resolve relative against base
    resolved := baseURL.ResolveReference(relativeURL)
    
    return resolved.String()
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

1. **URL Resolution Tests** (`link_test.go`)
   - Absolute URL handling
   - Relative path resolution
   - Root-relative path resolution
   - Edge cases (no base URL, malformed URLs)

2. **Navigation Callback Tests** (`link_test.go`)
   - Callback registration
   - Callback invocation on navigation
   - Integration with renderer

3. **Link Rendering Tests** (`link_integration_test.go`)
   - Single link rendering
   - Multiple links rendering
   - Links with nested elements
   - Display list integration

4. **Link Click Navigation Tests** (`link_integration_test.go`)
   - Simulated click handling
   - URL tracking
   - Multiple navigation scenarios

All tests pass successfully with no security vulnerabilities detected.

## Usage Example

```go
// In main.go
browser := ui.NewBrowser()

browser.SetNavigationCallback(func(url string) {
    loadPage(browser, fetcher, parser, jsRuntime, url)
})

// Links in HTML will now trigger navigation
html := `
<html>
<body>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://example.com">Example.com</a></p>
    <p>Or go to <a href="/about">About Page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
`
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Link Targets** (`_blank`, `_self`, etc.)
   - Currently documented but not implemented
   - Requires tab support in the browser UI
   - Planned for Phase 1 UI Improvements (see ROADMAP.md)

2. **Link States**
   - Visited link styling (purple color)
   - Active link styling
   - Focus indicators

3. **Special Link Types**
   - Anchor links (`#section`) for in-page navigation
   - `mailto:` links
   - `tel:` links
   - Download links

4. **Context Menu**
   - Right-click to open in new tab/window
   - Copy link address
   - Save link as...

## Security Considerations

- URLs are properly validated and parsed before use
- No injection vulnerabilities in URL handling
- Malformed URLs fall back to displaying as text
- No security alerts from CodeQL analysis

## Performance

- Links use the display list caching system
- No performance impact on scrolling or rendering
- URL resolution is done once during rendering
- Callback invocation is immediate with no blocking

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Anchor tags are rendered as clickable elements
✅ Clicking links triggers navigation correctly
✅ Visual feedback is provided for user interactions
✅ Both internal and external links work as expected
✅ Keyboard navigation is functional
✅ URL resolution handles absolute, relative, and root-relative paths
✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
